## Background

- Psychologists have defined 6 domains of creativity
  + Artistic
  + Science/math/engineering (STEM)
  + Social
  + Sales and business
  + Daily life problem solving
  + Community leadership
- ***What are the effects of social and economic capital on self-assessed creativity across domains?***
- We used multiple linear regression with Lasso to select variables

## Data Structure

- Used “Self-Perceptions of Creativity & Arts Participation, United States, 2018” dataset
  + Survey of 3447 US adults
  + 258 variables
- 43 questions across the 6 creativity domains in the form: *"Compared to people of approximately your age and life experience, how creative would you rate yourself for each of the following activities?"*  Examples include:
  + *Making up lyrics to a song* (Artistic)
  + *Building something mechanical, like a robot* (STEM)
  + *Mediating a dispute between two friends* (Social)
  + *Pitching your ideas to other people* (Business)
  + *Creating a tasty meal out of scattered leftovers* (Daily)
  + *Organizing a petition, rally, or boycott of a product* (Community)


## Data Structure

- Previous study found strong correlation between Social, Business, Daily, and Community domains, so we combined them into an SBDC domain

![](Correlation between domains.png)

- We averaged responses (1 = "Much less creative", 5 = "Much more creative") for all questions within a domain to get three creativity indices to serve as responses

## Data Structure

- Selected 26 predictors that measure social and economic capital plus 3 control variables
- 13 measured different forms of social help, such as, *"Do you know anyone who can loan you a large sum of money?"*
  + We created a Social Help Index (SHI) that summed the "Yes" responses for these 13 variables
  + Tested models using the 13 separate questions as well as model using SHI instead
- Deleted observations containing at least one missing value for variables we kept, leaving 3279 observations

## Statistical Method

- Performed 3 multiple linear regressions
  + One each with Artistic, STEM, and SBDC creativity indices as response
  + Used all predictors except SHI
  + Checked assumptions - Residuals not normal
```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
stem.fit.all <- lm(stem ~ . -artistic -sbd -SHI, data = creativity)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(stem.fit.all, which=1:2)
```
  + Removed all outliers (32) with Studentized deleted residuals beyond $\pm$ 3

## Statistical Method

- Regressions were significant but Adjusted $R^2$ was low:

Domain | Q5 Model Adjusted $R^2$ | SHI Model Adjusted $R^2$
-|-|-
Artistic | 0.1124 | 0.0885
STEM | 0.1448 | 0.1320
SBDC | 0.1810 | 0.1524

- Could not rely on p-values due to normality violation
  + Coefficient estimates still valid
- Focused on variable selection instead
- Conducted Stepwise Selection and Lasso on each model
  + Stepwise: $p_{enter} = 0.05$ and $p_{remain} = 0.10$
  + Lasso: considered both $\lambda_{min}$ and $\lambda_{1se}$
- Preferred Lasso with $\lambda_{1se}$

## Analysis Result

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Table of selected variables.png')
```

## Analysis Result

- SHI was selected and positive across all 3 domains
- These 4 social help questions positively predicted creativity across all 3 domains:
  + Q5H - *Do you know anyone who is sometimes in the position to hire people?*
  + Q5K - *Do you know anyone who knows a lot about financial matters (taxes, loans)?*
  + Q5L - *Do you know anyone who can give advice on matters of law (problems with landlords, going to court, etc.)?*
  + Q5M - *Do you know anyone who has good contacts with a newspaper, radio, TV station or blogger?*
- All four questions involve professional contacts

## Analysis Result

- These predictors had opposite signs in different domains:
  + Being **male** increased self-perceived creativity in STEM but decreased it in Artistic; it was not selected in SBDC
  + **Age** had a positive relationship with SBDC creativity, a negative one with STEM, and was not selected for Artistic
  + Being **Asian** increased self-perceived Artistic creativity but decreased SBDC; it was not selected for STEM

## Analysis Result

- Artistic
  + Positive relationship
    * Knowing someone who can loan you money
    * Knowing someone who can advise on family conflicts
    * Not working
  + Negative relationship
    * Working or being retired
    * Income
    * Having internet
    * Owning or renting your residence (vice occupying)
<p>&nbsp;</p>
- STEM
  + Positive relationship
    * Knowing someone who can repair a bike or car
    
## Analysis Result

- SBDC
  + Positive relationship
    * Knowing someone who can loan you money
    * Knowing someone who can advise on family conflicts
    * Knowing someone who can be a good job reference
    * Knowing someone in local government
    * Education
  + Negative relationship
    * Parents were NOT immigrants
<p>&nbsp;</p>
- Variables NOT selected for any domain
  + Respondent's immigrant status
  + Marital status
  + Number of children/adults in household

## Discussion

- Our findings suggest certain stereotypes have been internalized
- Further hypothesis testing is messy without normal residuals
- Our low $R^2$ values indicate our predictors cannot explain a large portion of the variability in self-perceived creativity
  + This is common in social science data
- All of these findings are examinations of *self-perceived* creativity, not actual creativity
