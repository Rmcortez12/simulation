*************************************

1.1 Definitions?? 

2.2.4 Probit Regression and the use of Auxiliary Variables
2.2.5 Finite Normal Mixture Model

  
4. Frequentist Inference - comment on it, but leave it out
4.1 Poisson Mixed Model



5. Closing Discussion
  he states "Our goal in this article is to explain variational approximations in a digestible form for a statistical audience" lolol
