1. Introduction
1.1 Definitions

2. Density Transform Approach

2.1 Kullback-leibler Divergence
- Why is this important?? 


2.2 Product Density Transforms
  -- Should probably only choose a couple from below? 
2.2.1 Connection with Gibbs Sampling
2.2.2 Normal Random Sample
2.2.3 Linear Mixed Model
2.2.4 Probit Regression and the use of Auxiliary Variables
2.2.5 Finite Normal Mixture Model

2.3 Parametric Density Transforms
2.3.1 Poisson Regreession with Gaussian Transform

3. Tangent Transform Approach
3.1 Bayesian Logistic Regression

4. Frequentist Inference
4.1 Poisson Mixed Model

5. Closing Discussion
  he states "Our goal in this article is to explain variational approximations in a digestible form for a statistical audience" lolol
